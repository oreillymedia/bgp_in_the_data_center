lo_ip_subnet: '10.254.0.0/27'
# The host_ip_base assumes that the lower 3 bytes are free for
# use with server IP address assignment. The second byte represents the rack
# (or leaf) number, the third byte to represent the VLAN used with the server
# and the lowest number in the dotted decimal format is the
# host IP address, with the first IP address reserved for the leaf's
# SVI. For example, the first leaf has the SVI address 10.1.20.1 and
# hosts attached to it have the IP address from 10.1.20.2-10.1.20.254.
# When used with dual-attached hosts, hosts in both racks get the second
# byte from the odd node's rack number. When used with VxLAN, the second
# byte is fixed to 253.
